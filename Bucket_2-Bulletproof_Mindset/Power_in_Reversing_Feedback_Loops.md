## Power in Reversing Feedback Loops 

What you do has the power to reverse the feedback loops in your relationship. Whenever you feel hopeless and frustrated, you must remember this. If you’re not reversing it, seek to improve your process.

* **Untethering yourself from partner & outcome:**  Don’t let partner/outcome determine your behavior, YOU determine your partner’s behavior and outcomes. This is a close cousin of victimization

  * Stop victimizing and tethering yourself. 

* **Remembering Delayed Effect of Reversing Feedback Loops:** Don’t expect to reverse your negative feedback loops overnight or in the short term. Your actions today will only show up though a delayed effect before your partner can see & feel your changes. 

* **Feedback Loops Create Chain Reactions & Exponentially:** As you continue to spot, break and reverse feedback loops, you will begin to create chain reactions that will result in even more exponential growth. 

* **You Alone Have Incredible Power to Rebuild Your Relationship:** Don’t underestimate your power. It takes just one to perpetuate or break a cycle. It does not take two to tango. Every single & small thing you do matters. Be detail-oriented, be a scientist, be relentless and implement everything. 

* **Focusing on Your Own Shit & Embracing Reversing Feedback Loops:** If you are wishing your partner didn’t do negative things, you’re missing the point. If your partner wasn’t doing negative things and there are no negative feedback loops, you would not be here. Focus on your own shit, what you can do, and embrace and take joy in reversing feedback loops. That’s the point. 

  * Always Think About What You Can Do
  * Cultivate Awareness of Feedback Loops & Chain Reactions
  * Don’t Skip Anything. They All Matter
  * Understand the Importance of Mindset
  * You Are More Powerful Than You Think

* **The more dire, the more you break cycles:** Failures use difficult moments as an excuse to go back to their old ways, feel demotivated, take the easy way out, and give up. Successful people use difficult moments as a reason to double down on their new self, feel motivated, take a hard road, and double down.
