Main Purpose/First Principles: The whole point of the frameworks is to allow you to appeal to their emotions to turn negative into positive (not logic) to regain trust, safety, clear up conflicts, misunderstandings and build all the 5 pillars.

General Notes on Execution of Frameworks

Power in Vulnerability:​ Be extra vulnerable whenever you can when paraphrasing with admission of what you did in the past and don’t be afraid to self-deprecate.

Tone, Rhythm & Personality:​ The tone, cadence and personality in which you say it will matter more than the words you say. A tone of discovery, humility, patience and invitation is good.

As a Leader, You Set the Tone:​ Recognize your own power in setting the tone of your conversations. If you treat the conversation as difficult, heavy and painful, so will your partner. Ensure tone is that of invitation, positivity, fun and light.

Dealing with Letters, Texts and Emails:​ Be extremely careful with letters texts and emails as it can be mis-interpreted in many ways you cannot imagine. Add more notes here.
Don’t 

See it Land & Let it Land:​ Take a moment to let your partner’s words land on you, and let your questions land on your partner. Add emotions to the whole process. Don’t go through the motions.

General Execution Notes
Plan Questions, Not Solutions/Statements:​ Do not come
to a conversation planning out your solutions. Plant our questions instead.

A Marathon that Requires BPV At All Times:​ It takes just one bad seed of mis-interpretation to derail the conversation. You must have Bucket 2 mastered and be able to properly interpret events around you perfectly as a performer and your BPV cannot have weak spots.

Avoiding Premature Assumptions (Thinking Via Antithesis)​: Do not make premature assumptions that tell you that you understand what your partner is saying. This will prevent you from asking more questions and asking bad & biased questions.

Your Hypothesis is Most Likely Wrong: ​No matter how sure you are of your hypothesis, always assume that it is wrong and that you are missing something. And most likely, you will find that you WERE wrong.

Thinking via Antithesis: Become an advanced thinker. Always assume your hypothesis is wrong, that you’re missing something, and that you mis-interpreted something. Let this fuel your questions.

How to Properly Deal with Emotion Vomits​: You need to learn how to deal with a situation when your partner will spew out 20 different things at once, and you don’t know how to deal with it.

Break up the conversation after 2-3 points
Listen with the intent to repeat & paraphrase.
Pick one point that seems important
Apply Step 3 to it

Do not Diffuse Discomfort with Humor:​ Conversations can get quite heavy, intense and difficult. Do not use humor to lighten the mood no matter how tempting it feels.

Don’t Need to Always Talk About the Relationship:​ There is a transitive property in relationships. You don’t always need to talk about the relationship to show changes in your process

Pushing Through Resistance: ​You MUST be able to push past resistance, and have the courage to do so, if you want to ever fight her confirmation-bias against you. Never fall into the trap of the false sense of peace you get by not bringing things up in your relationship.

How to understand when to stop pushing through resistance and going into the 4-part script.

Retreating with the 4-Part Script: To be used anytime you cannot break through resistance with the previous 2 frameworks. The goal here is to retreat while planting the BEST and MOST seeds possible.

What Happens After You Retreat: After you retreat, you will want to pick a topic that is lighter for you to address.

General Execution Notes for the 4-Part Script
This is NOT a script​. Understand the first-principles of each
part and improvise your own approach to fit your situation.

Requires BPV At All Times:​ The tone & personality matters more than what you say. And you also must understand how to remain courageous despite your partner’s resistances.

Do not be afraid of repetition:​ Repetition is not a bad thing, it is a necessary part of the process. You need to probably repeat your retreat many times before you can break through her confirmation bias.

Don’t Fall for the Beggar Mentality:​ Do not retreat with the tone of begging and loss. Have the tone that you are the one trying to rescue her, and she can take your help whenever she is ready.
