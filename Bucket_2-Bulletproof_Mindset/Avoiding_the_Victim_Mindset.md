## Avoiding the Victim Mindset

Victimizing and blaming things outside your control feels good, and you will find a strong allure to victimize. But as soon as you blame your partner, the program, or something else outside yourself, you will stop asking questions,  never have good answers and fail to execute Bucket 1 at all, or properly, and you will feel powerless.

* **Why & how victimizing feels good (Allure)**
  * You don’t need to feel guilty 
  * You get certainty
  * Absolves you of any work
  * Allows you to justify your failures
  * Allows you to feel compassion for yourself

**Losers use these excuses!**


* How victimizing will lead to failure (The dangers of playing victim)
  * Makes you stop seeking answers
  * Makes you stop seeking answers within your control
  * Makes people defensive & perpetuates blame game
  * Admitting you are powerless
  * Infiltrates you subconsciously

* Examples of victimizing
  * The equal blame illusion - blaming your partner
  * The “most people” illusion - blaming other people 
  * The abused victim illusion - blaming partner for abuse
  * The power illusion - blaming your partner for being toxic
  * I’m only human illusion

**Failures** play victim, and they fail, and continue failing, **BECAUSE** of their partner, circumstances or other things outside their control.

**Successful people** take control, and they succeed **DESPITE** their partner, circumstances or other things outside their control.

**Failures fail because they take the easy road & give up their steering wheel.**

**Successful people succeed because they chose to take the hard road but have the steering wheel.**

* The last words of victims
  * It’s because of _______
  * I wish my partner was more ________
  * My partner should do more _______
  * I am waiting for my partner to _______

* **Not Relying on Hope:** If you’re hoping and you’re okay with it, it will prevent you from seeking answers from the program, from your partner, and better ways to do, think and execute something. **Hope is a terrible strategy.**
