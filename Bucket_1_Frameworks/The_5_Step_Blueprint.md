## The 5 Step Blueprint 

This is a framework (not a script) for ALL conversations going forward. You must understand the main point of each step and improvise yourself. Improvise all you want but make sure to stay within the framework.

* **What is the main purpose?**
 * Framework for all conversations
 * Designed to Lower Defensiveness
 * Leads to Opening & Healing
 * Creates Emotional Safety
 * Designed for your to be Agile

* **General Execution Notes**
 * **Plan Questions, Not Solutions/Statements:​** Do not come
to a conversation planning out your solutions. Plant our questions instead.

 * **A Marathon that Requires BPV At All Times:**​ It takes just one bad seed of mis-interpretation to derail the conversation. You must have Bucket 2 mastered and be able to properly interpret events around you perfectly as a performer and your BPV cannot have weak spots.

 * **Avoiding Premature Assumptions (Thinking Via Antithesis)​:** Do not make premature assumptions that tell you that you understand what your partner is saying. This will prevent you from asking more questions and asking bad & biased questions.

     * **Your Hypothesis is Most Likely Wrong:** ​No matter how sure you are of your hypothesis, always assume that it is wrong and that you are missing something. And most likely, you will find that you WERE wrong.

     * **Thinking via Antithesis:** Become an advanced thinker. Always assume your hypothesis is wrong, that you’re missing something, and that you mis-interpreted something. Let this fuel your questions.

 * **How to Properly Deal with Emotion Vomits​:** You need to learn how to deal with a situation when your partner will spew out 20 different things at once, and you don’t know how to deal with it.

     * Break up the conversation after 2-3 points
     * Listen with the intent to repeat & paraphrase.
     * Pick one point that seems important
     * Apply Step 3 to it

 * **Do not Diffuse Discomfort with Humor:**​ Conversations can get quite heavy, intense and difficult. Do not use humor to lighten the mood no matter how tempting it feels.

 * **Don’t Need to Always Talk About the Relationship:​** There is a transitive property in relationships. You don’t always need to talk about the relationship to show changes in your process
