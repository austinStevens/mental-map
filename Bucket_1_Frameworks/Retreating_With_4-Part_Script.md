  * **Requires BPV At All Times:** The tone & personality matters more than what you say. And you also must understand how to remain courageous despite your partner’s resistances.

  * **Do not be afraid of repetition:** Repetition is not a bad thing, it is a necessary part of the process. You need to probably repeat your retreat many times before you can break through her confirmation bias.

  * **Don’t Fall for the Beggar Mentality:** Do not retreat with the tone of begging and loss. Have the tone that you are the one trying to rescue her, and she can take your help whenever she is ready.
